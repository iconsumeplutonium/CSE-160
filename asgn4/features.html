<h3>Notes to Grader</h3>

This assignment meets all the requirements of the rubric. <br><br>

<ul>
    <li>There is a first person camera with a pointer lock (controls are listed on the right side)</li>
    <li>I have multiple cubes in the world</li>
    <li>I have multiple spheres in the world</li>
    <li>Lighting works, and you can change the color of the light with the color picker (remember to change the alpha value of the color in the picker)</li>
    <li>The light location is demarcated by a floating cube (whose color changes with the light color)</li>
    <li>The light can be moved with the sliders, but there is also a checkbox to move the light around the world</li>
    <li>There is a dropdown that lets you switch between a point light and a spotlight</li>
    <li>There are sliders to adjust the size of the spotlight and the falloff of light from the spotlight</li>
    <li>There are three buttons on the right side to change between Lighting, No Lighting, and Normals</li>
</ul>

When you select the view mode to draw Normals, you might notice that three of the skybox faces turn black. The south and east faces turn black because in those directions, the normals are negative <br>
([0 0 -1] and [-1 0 0]) which turns black. However, the reason the face above is black is because of the way I have the skybox set up. <br><br>

I used my block world code as the base for this assignment, and for that assignment, I enabled backface culling for optimization. However, this deleted my skybox, so I instead placed 6 cubes around the player at equal distances to make it look like it was one singular cube.<br>
This carried over into this assignment. Because of this, when you look up, what you are seeing is actually the <em>bottom</em> of that skybox cube. The normals of the bottom face are [0 -1 0], which also appears black.
