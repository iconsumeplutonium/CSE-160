        <h3>Notes to Grader:</h3>
        <p>
            There is a directional light on the TIE interceptor, and as the ship flies around, it lights up the objects from different angles. There is also an ambient and hemisphere light. <br>
            There are 20 objects: the primary three (icosahedron, command block, sphere with face), the TIE interceptor, and 16 other objects. These objects are given a random color and <br>
            random position in the scene. <br>
            There is also a skybox and orbit controls.
