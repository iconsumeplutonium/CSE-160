<b>Notes to Grader</b><br>
So for the drawing we're supposed to do, I actually didn't do it on paper at all. However, I believe the method I used to make the drawing <br>
makes up for it. <br> <br>

So firstly, I decided I wanted to draw out the side profile of the Imperial I class Star Destroyer, so I scoured Google until I found an image I liked. <br>

<br><br>

I opened the image in Photoshop and I traced out an approximate outline of the ship. After that, I drew dots at the corner points of <br>
my new outline, representing the vertices of the drawing. Then I drew lines between the dots in such a way that the entire drawing was comprised of <br>
triangles. I have also uploaded the PSD file as <code>star destroyer.psd</code> in the <code>images</code> folder, alongside
the other screenshots I have embedded in this page.

        The Star Destroyer, but <em>only</em> my outline and triangle drawings. It turns out I forgot to close a couple of <br>
        triangles in this drawing, but I later fixed it when I was coding the drawing.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>All in all, there are a grand total of 41 vertices and 40 triangles making up my image.
